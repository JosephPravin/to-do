Overview
You will build a Trello-like “to do” board. This board will have columns for items assigned to
each user, and cards for each user that explains their task. The user will be able to add
columns on click and cards as well. Use window.prompt to prompt the user for what the
column title and card text should be.

Instructions
Look at the attached design spec for a react application. It’s not complete and pixel perfect, so
use your best estimation in terms of how wide/tall everything should be.

First, give a list of all the components you would build to create this app and how they would
be nested as well as what inputs they would need. For example, you might start like below
(finish this list of components you would build, with all the props/inputs those components
would expect):

Steps
1. App Component
a. Column Container Component
b. Column Name Component (inputs: a string variable with the username/column
title)

2. Card Component (inputs: a string variable with the text of the card — the “to do” that is
assigned to the user)
3. Build out the components

Tips
* Use create-react-app
* Using flexbox or grid is recommended, though not required
* Output should be responsive (columns should wrap automatically)
